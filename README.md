# dotfiles - efficient setup of new machines :rocket:

* This dotfile repo is my collection of config scripts and templates for various POSIX-like systems. I've used it on MacOS, Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS.
* I run it to set up new development machines with my preferred development tools and environments.
* It installs things such as
    * Preferred packages for different package managers, including casks for Homebrew
    * Usual needed compilers and build-tools
    * Preferred ViM settings, Git config, shell colours, rc-files, etc.
    * Installs and defaults Z-shell (Zsh) with the oh-my-zsh framework
    * A long list of useful shell aliases, functions, etc.
    * Templates for development, such as directory structure, Makefiles and CMakeLists.txt files.
